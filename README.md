DLBCLdata
=========

The **DLBCLdata** package for **R** automates the download and preprocessing of large-scale Gene Expression Profile (GEP) studies of Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma (DLBCL) from the NCBI (National Center for Biotechnical Information) GEO (Gene Expression Omnibus) website. It provides **R** users with *reproducible* and *easy* access to these GEP data otherwise cumbersome manual procedure of downloading and preprocessing. The package handles the RMA preprocessing of the studies of DLBCL using the manufacturer's or custom Brainarray chip definition files (CDF) including the installation of these CDFs.

The package is (hopefully) written with enough generality to allow expansion to other DLBCL and even non-DLBCL datasets (under an new package name).

## Installation
To install the latest version of **DLBCLdata** directly from the master branch at GitHub, run

```R
install.packages("devtools")  # If devtools is not installed
devtools::install_github("AEBilgrau/DLBCLdata")
```

Note, that this version is in development and, as such, it may be unstable. For previous versions of **DLBCLdata**, visit the old [releases at GitHub](https://github.com/AEBilgrau/DLBCLdata/releases).

## Usage
The package *should* work with any NCBI GEO repository containing geneexpression data. However, the package is tailored specifically to some DLBCL GEO accession numbers. To get an overview of the directly "supported" GEO numbers, see

```R
data(DLBCL_overview)
View(DLBCL_overview)
```

To download and process a specific GEO number, simply run

```R
res_gse56315 <- downloadAndProcessGEO("GSE56315")
```
or more specifically

```R
res_gse56315 <- 
  downloadAndProcessGEO("GSE56315", cdf = "brainarray", target = "ensg")
```

The former downloads the `.CEL` files and RMA preprocesses the data present in GSE56315 [1] using the standard Affymetrix CDF files. The latter downloads and preprocess directly to Ensembl gene identifiers (ENSG)  using RMA normalization and custom Brainarray CDFs [2].

To download and preprocesses *all* datasets featured in **DLBCLdata** (show with `DLBCL_overview`) using, say, brainarray to Entrez gene identifiers the following line will do so.

```R
dlbcl_data <- downloadAndProcessDLBCL(cdf = "brainarray", target = "ENTREZG")
```

This function creates the file `dlbcl_data.Rds` in the working directory which can later be read into **R** with `readRDS`.
